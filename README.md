# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Two players take turns placing "0" and "X" in a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins the game. If all boxes are filled and no one wins, the game ends in a draw.
